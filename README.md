#WalkTalk

It's a game where you walk and talk.

So the basic scenario of the game goes as such:
1. Your character walks across the screen.
2. Your character bumps into an npc.
3. A dialogue window opens.
4. You have two choices and you're given either a reward or not.
5. The reward gives you money, and with money you buy upgrades to your character.
6. You continue walking across the screen.

Other ideas:
1. Walking through the forest and encounter animals/merchants/travelers
2. Some npcs try to kill you, you have to protect yourself
3. You can make an npc mad, then they want to kill you

Core idea here is that it's a 'cookie clicker' type game that given enough time
you could eventually just leave the game running to collect stuff for you.
